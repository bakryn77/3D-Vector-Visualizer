3D Vector Visualizer

A beginner Python tool for performing and visualising basic 3D vector operations.
Built as part of my foundational math + Python learning path before expanding into robotics and computer vision–based interfaces.

Features

3D vector input through a clean CLI

Adds, subtracts, and normalises vectors

Computes dot products and magnitudes

Uses NumPy for accurate vector math

Modular folder structure for future upgrades (GUI, CV mode, gesture controls)
